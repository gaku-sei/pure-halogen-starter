## Pure Halogen Starter

This starter is an extremely light weighted (and slightly tweaked) version of the [Halogen realworld](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld) repository by [Thomas Honeyman](https://thomashoneyman.com/).

It contains only a couple of pages, but also implements the [capability pattern](https://thomashoneyman.com/guides/real-world-halogen/push-effects-to-the-edges/) and provides all you need to get started 😁

### Incoming
